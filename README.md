# Quintris

**Quintris** is a browser-based Tetris-inspired game developed to explore custom game logic, UI design, and full-stack web architecture. Built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** on the frontend, it extends the classic Tetris gameplay with additional block shapes. A custom **Node.js** backend powers the leaderboard system with a **PostgreSQL** database, deployed via **Railway**.

**Live Demo**: [pjbcallaghan.github.io/Quintris](https://pjbcallaghan.github.io/Quintris)

**Controls**: Use arrow keys or WASD to move and rotate the Tetris piece, and use the spacebar to store it.
